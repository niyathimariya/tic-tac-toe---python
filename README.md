# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid, aiming to be the first to complete a row, column, or diagonal with their symbol (X or O).

## How to Play

1. Run the `tic_tac_toe.py` script using Python.
2. Players take turns entering row and column numbers to place their symbol on the board.
3. The game continues until one player wins or the board is filled, resulting in a tie.
4. Follow the instructions in the terminal to navigate the game.
